## Task 15: Agent-Ready MCP Server

### Request

Add an MCP-style agent interface so Codex and other agents can use KIE workflows directly, with a commit structure that makes changes easy to analyze and roll back.

### Planned Scope

- Add open-source basics:
  - `LICENSE`
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md`
  - `SECURITY.md`
  - GitHub Actions unit-test workflow
- Add package-local MCP resources for agent-readable docs, supported models, and tool contracts.
- Add a `kie-mcp` entrypoint and MCP server module.
- Expose safe, dry-run-first tools for upload, image, video, chat, Suno, status, and wait workflows.
- Add MCP docs and example client configuration.
- Add tests for MCP tool functions/resources without requiring live KIE calls.
- Commit in small slices so each layer can be reviewed or reverted independently.

### Status

In progress.

### Implementation Notes

- Commit `22f3a45` added open-source project basics:
  - MIT `LICENSE`
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md`
  - `SECURITY.md`
  - GitHub Actions unit-test workflow
  - README license/contribution links
- Added package-local MCP resources under `src/kie_cli/mcp_resources/` so installed agents can read compact KIE context without GitHub Raw or network access.
- Added `src/kie_cli/mcp_server.py` with import-lazy FastMCP registration, package-local resources, prompts, and dry-run-first KIE tools.
- Added optional `mcp` extra and `kie-mcp` console entrypoint in `pyproject.toml`.
- Added `docs/mcp.md` and example MCP client configs under `examples/mcp/`.
- Added offline MCP tests in `tests/test_mcp_server.py` for resources, dry-run tool payloads, prompt builders, and optional dependency behavior.

### Commit Structure

- `22f3a45` - Add open source project basics
- `71051aa` - Add package-local MCP resources
- `275012b` - Add dry-run-first KIE MCP server
- `0dadf5d` - Document MCP setup for agents

### Verification

Ran the full local test suite:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
```

Result: 62 passed, 10 skipped.

---

## Task 14: Initial GitHub Publish

### Request

Push the prepared open-source repository to GitHub using:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:hassanvfx/kie-api-python.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Planned Scope

- Confirm ignored local artifacts remain excluded from Git.
- Stage the public release files.
- Create the initial public-release commit with documentation and journal context.
- Add the GitHub SSH remote, ensure the branch is named `main`, and push upstream.

### Verification Before Commit

`git check-ignore` confirmed these local artifacts are ignored:

- `.env`
- `.venv`
- `outputs/`
- `src/kie_cli/__pycache__/`
- `.pytest_cache/`
- `.DS_Store`

### Implementation Summary

- Staged the Git-visible public release files with `.env` and generated local artifacts excluded by `.gitignore`.
- Ran a pre-commit secret-pattern scan; only documented placeholder examples like `KIE_API_KEY=your_kie_api_key` were found.
- Created initial commit `6130cab` with message `Prepare initial public release`.
- Added remote `origin` as `git@github.com:hassanvfx/kie-api-python.git`.
- Ensured the local branch is named `main`.
- Pushed `main` and set upstream tracking to `origin/main`.

### Status

Complete.

## Task 13: Public Release Hygiene and README Refresh

### Request

Prepare the `kie-api` repository for open sourcing by ensuring `.env` and other local/generated files are protected by ignore rules, checking for obvious sensitive content, and replacing the short README with a proper public-facing introduction that points contributors toward the official KIE docs.

### Planned Scope

- Review existing `.gitignore` coverage for secrets, Python caches, virtual environments, live outputs, and OS/editor noise.
- Add a safe `.env.example` so contributors know which variables are expected without exposing real credentials.
- Refresh `README.md` with installation, usage, testing, contribution, and security guidance.
- Encourage contributors to extend and maintain implementation coverage against `https://docs.kie.ai/`.
- Run a lightweight secret-pattern scan across the publishable tree.

### Technical Decisions

- Keep `.env` and `.env.*` ignored while explicitly allowing `.env.example`.
- Ignore all `outputs/` content because live integration tests can create generated media metadata and task fixtures.
- Preserve the existing ClineFlow/project documentation files, but ignore per-developer assistant/tool state directories.
- Do not add a `LICENSE` automatically because the correct open-source license requires owner intent.
- Do not remove local files during this task; instead, prevent future accidental adds and report local artifacts that should remain untracked.

### Implementation Summary

- Expanded `.gitignore` to cover:
  - local environment files and private key material
  - Python bytecode, coverage, test, type-check, and lint caches
  - virtual environments and packaging artifacts
  - generated runtime/live-test outputs
  - editor and OS noise
- Added `.env.example` with non-secret placeholders for KIE API settings and live-test controls.
- Replaced `README.md` with a public-facing guide covering:
  - supported CLI surface
  - install/setup
  - example commands
  - async polling workflow
  - tests and live-test warnings
  - project layout
  - contribution workflow against the official KIE docs
  - security notes for open sourcing
- Initialized a new Git repository on `main` after confirming the directory was not already a worktree, then verified ignore behavior directly with Git.

### Verification

Ran a secret-pattern scan excluding known local/generated folders:

```bash
rg -n --hidden -g '!.env' -g '!.env.*' -g '!__pycache__/**' -g '!*.pyc' -g '!.venv/**' -g '!.pytest_cache/**' -g '!outputs/**' -g '!docs/kie-ai/raw/**' '(api[_-]?key|secret|token|password|BEGIN (RSA|OPENSSH|PRIVATE) KEY|sk-[A-Za-z0-9])' .
```

The scan found expected references to environment variable names, authorization code paths, token usage fields, and documentation text, but did not reveal a committed credential in the publishable tree.

Initialized Git and verified ignore behavior:

```bash
git init --initial-branch=main
git check-ignore -q .env
git check-ignore -q outputs
git check-ignore -q .env.example
```

Results:

- `.env` is ignored.
- `outputs/` is ignored.
- `.env.example` is not ignored and is available to commit.

Ran the local test suite:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
```

Result: 52 passed, 10 skipped.

### Status

Complete.

## Task 1: Download KIE Documentation Corpus

### Request

Create the first implementation step for the future `kie-cli` prototype by downloading all KIE documentation pages referenced in the task prompt.

### Planned Scope

- Add a reusable downloader script for KIE docs.
- Save raw Markdown docs into `docs/kie-ai/raw/`, preserving URL path structure.
- Write `docs/kie-ai/manifest.json` with URL, local path, HTTP status, hash, size, timestamp, and any failure details.
- Use the downloaded docs as the local source of truth for the later Python CLI implementation, including upload-first handling for local files.

### Technical Decisions

- Keep this step limited to documentation ingestion; no CLI/API implementation yet.
- Preserve both English and Chinese docs because the prompt includes both.
- Deduplicate repeated URLs before download.
- Continue past individual download failures and record them in the manifest.

### Implementation Summary

- Added `scripts/download_kie_docs.py`, a reusable downloader that shells out to `curl`.
- Downloaded the KIE docs index from `https://docs.kie.ai/llms.txt`.
- Extracted 400 unique KIE documentation URLs from the docs index.
- Mirrored the docs into `docs/kie-ai/raw/`, preserving URL path structure.
- Wrote `docs/kie-ai/manifest.json` with per-document metadata.
- Re-ran the downloader after interruption with cache detection, so existing files were not repeatedly re-downloaded.
- Verified that all manifest entries have local files.

### Verification

```bash
python3 -m py_compile scripts/download_kie_docs.py
```

```json
{
  "manifest_counts": {
    "total_docs": 400,
    "available": 400,
    "downloaded": 38,
    "cached": 362,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "raw_file_count_including_llms": 401,
  "missing_manifest_files": 0,
  "script_compiles": true
}
```

### Issue and Resolution

The initial long-running download was interrupted before it wrote `docs/kie-ai/manifest.json`, leaving 363 raw files without a manifest. The downloader was updated to treat already-present files as `cached`, then rerun to complete the missing files and generate a complete manifest.

### Status

Complete.

## Task 12: Comprehensive Production-Facing CLI Documentation Excluding Gemini

### Request

Create a polished, long-form documentation package for `kie-cli` that explains the production-ready service surface in enough depth for:

- engineering onboarding
- product and sales positioning
- future maintenance of the CLI command and async model

Gemini was explicitly excluded from the production-facing scope because provider live validation remained blocked/unreliable.

### Planned Scope

- Add a new long-form documentation guide under `docs/kie-cli/`.
- Cover the production-ready command families:
  - upload
  - image
  - video
  - GPT-5.2 LLM
  - Suno music
  - Suno lyrics
  - Suno sounds
  - job-status
  - wait
- Document:
  - payload shapes
  - normalized output/result shapes
  - async lifecycle
  - durable job records
  - model-routed polling
  - provider caveats and live findings
- Refresh `README.md` into a concise landing page that points to the full guide.

### Technical Decisions

- Treat `docs/kie-cli/comprehensive-guide.md` as the canonical production-facing document.
- Exclude Gemini from the primary capability matrix, examples, and positioning sections, while still noting briefly that the family exists experimentally but is not production-ready.
- Use the actual implementation and test corpus as the source of truth rather than loosely paraphrasing provider marketing language.
- Include contract-like JSON examples so the document doubles as both user documentation and an integration reference.

### Implementation Summary

- Added `docs/kie-cli/comprehensive-guide.md` as the main long-form documentation deliverable.
- Documented the production-ready CLI surface:
  - `kie-cli upload`
  - `kie-cli image nano-banana-pro`
  - `kie-cli image gpt-image-2`
  - `kie-cli video grok`
  - `kie-cli video veo3`
  - `kie-cli llm gpt-5-2`
  - `kie-cli suno music`
  - `kie-cli suno lyrics`
  - `kie-cli suno sounds`
  - `kie-cli job-status`
  - `kie-cli wait`
- Added detailed sections for:
  - executive overview
  - capability matrix
  - installation/setup
  - CLI mental model
  - command-by-command usage
  - async lifecycle
  - contract/reference shapes
  - service-specific deep dives
  - live validation notes
  - troubleshooting
  - internal positioning / “what we can vend”
- Captured important live-tested Suno findings:
  - music requires explicit provider model in live usage
  - lyrics requires `callBackUrl`
  - sounds is polled through the Suno music record-info route
- Reworked `README.md` into a short entrypoint that links readers to the comprehensive guide.

### Verification

Documentation content was validated against the implementation and test corpus, especially:

- `src/kie_cli/cli.py`
- `src/kie_cli/client.py`
- `src/kie_cli/payloads.py`
- `src/kie_cli/routes.py`
- `src/kie_cli/status.py`
- `src/kie_cli/polling.py`
- `src/kie_cli/jobs.py`
- `src/kie_cli/llm.py`
- `tests/test_payloads.py`
- `tests/test_cli_jobs.py`
- `tests/test_jobs_polling.py`
- `tests/test_llm.py`
- `tests/integration/test_live_kie.py`

### Status

Complete.

## Task 10: Focused Suno Music, Lyrics, and Sounds CLI Support

### Request

Add first-pass Suno CLI support focused only on:

- music generation
- lyrics generation
- sounds generation

### Planned Scope

- Add `kie-cli suno music`, `kie-cli suno lyrics`, and `kie-cli suno sounds`.
- Add payload builders for the three focused Suno create-task flows.
- Add client methods for Suno create and details endpoints.
- Extend model-based async routing and polling to support:
  - `suno-music`
  - `suno-sounds`
  - `suno-lyrics`
- Support dry-run payload inspection for all three commands.
- Support `--save-job` for music and sounds.
- Add unit coverage for payload builders, CLI dry-run/save-job behavior, and Suno polling route selection.
- Update README with Suno usage examples and callback expectations.

### Technical Decisions

- Use a single top-level `suno` command with subcommands rather than spreading Suno features across `llm`, `image`, or `video`.
- Keep callback handling permissive in the CLI first pass: expose `--callback-url`, include it when provided, but do not force it client-side because server-side enforcement still needs live confirmation.
- Treat Suno sounds as sharing the music polling/details endpoint, consistent with the local docs.
- Use synthetic CLI model aliases for async routing:
  - `suno-music`
  - `suno-sounds`
  - `suno-lyrics`

### Implementation Summary

- Extended `src/kie_cli/client.py` with Suno create/details methods for music, lyrics, and sounds submission.
- Added Suno payload builders in `src/kie_cli/payloads.py`:
  - `build_suno_music_payload()`
  - `build_suno_lyrics_payload()`
  - `build_suno_sounds_payload()`
- Extended `src/kie_cli/routes.py` with Suno route metadata and status endpoint resolution.
- Extended `src/kie_cli/polling.py` and `src/kie_cli/status.py` to support Suno music/sounds polling plus dedicated lyrics polling/status normalization.
- Added `kie-cli suno music`, `kie-cli suno lyrics`, and `kie-cli suno sounds` in `src/kie_cli/cli.py`.
- Added `--save-job` support for Suno music and sounds using model-routed job records.
- Added/updated tests for:
  - Suno payload construction
  - dry-run CLI output
  - save-job persistence
  - Suno route resolution
  - Suno status polling paths
- Updated `README.md` with Suno usage examples, callback caveat, job-status examples, and supported async route models.

### Verification

Planned verification after implementation:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_payloads.py tests/test_cli_jobs.py tests/test_jobs_polling.py -q
```

### Status

Implementation complete. Verification pending targeted test run.

## Task 11: Live Suno Async Tests for Music, Lyrics, and Sounds

### Request

Add and run real live Suno tests for:

- music generation
- lyrics generation
- sounds generation

following the async pattern of submit → get task ID → poll → verify final result.

### Planned Scope

- Extend the gated live integration harness in `tests/integration/test_live_kie.py`.
- Add a dedicated `KIE_LIVE_SCOPE=suno`.
- Add live cases for:
  - `kie-cli suno music`
  - `kie-cli suno lyrics`
  - `kie-cli suno sounds`
- Reuse existing fixture capture under `outputs/live_tests/<timestamp>/<case>/`.
- Support callback-aware live execution using `KIE_SUNO_CALLBACK_URL`.
- Poll music and sounds through saved job records.
- Poll lyrics by explicit task ID with `--model suno-lyrics`.

### Technical Decisions

- Suno live tests require a callback URL, so the harness now reads `KIE_SUNO_CALLBACK_URL` and skips Suno live cases if it is not provided.
- Suno music live submission must include an explicit provider model; live validation confirmed that omitting it causes a 422 validation error.
- Music and sounds use `--save-job` plus `kie-cli wait --job-file ...`.
- Lyrics uses direct polling with:
  - `kie-cli wait TASK_ID --model suno-lyrics --json`
- Fixture persistence mirrors the existing image/video async acceptance workflow.

### Implementation Summary

- Updated `tests/integration/test_live_kie.py` to support:
  - `KIE_LIVE_SCOPE=suno`
  - `KIE_SUNO_CALLBACK_URL`
- Added Suno-specific helpers for:
  - async submit + wait for music/sounds
  - task-ID submit + wait for lyrics
- Added live tests:
  - `test_live_suno_music`
  - `test_live_suno_lyrics`
  - `test_live_suno_sounds`
- Captured real provider-side validation failures during the first run:
  - music required explicit `--model`
  - lyrics required `callBackUrl`
- Adjusted the live harness accordingly and reran successfully.

### Verification

Initial failing live run without the required Suno-specific provider inputs:

```bash
RUN_KIE_LIVE_TESTS=1 KIE_LIVE_SCOPE=suno \
  .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/integration -q
```

Observed provider validation failures:

- music:
  - `model cannot be null, only V3_5, V4, V4_5, V4_5PLUS, V4_5ALL, V5, V5_5`
- lyrics:
  - `Please enter callBackUrl.`

Successful live rerun:

```bash
RUN_KIE_LIVE_TESTS=1 KIE_LIVE_SCOPE=suno KIE_SUNO_CALLBACK_URL=https://example.com/callback \
  .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/integration -q
```

Result:

```text
3 passed, 7 skipped in 238.62s (0:03:58)
```

### Status

Complete.

## Task 2: Focused Image and Video Generation CLI

### Request

Implement the first usable `kie-cli` prototype focused on:

- Image generation/editing with image references and prompts:
  - `nano-banana-pro`
  - `gpt-image-2-text-to-image`
  - `gpt-image-2-image-to-image`
- Video generation with image references and prompts:
  - `grok-imagine/text-to-video`
  - `grok-imagine/image-to-video`
  - Veo3.1 family: `veo3`, `veo3_fast`, `veo3_lite`
- Use dotenv for storing the KIE API key.

### Planned Scope

- Add Python package scaffold and console command `kie-cli`.
- Load configuration from `.env` using `python-dotenv`.
- Keep `.env` ignored and provide `.env.example`.
- Implement local-file upload through the KIE temp file API before generation.
- Pass remote `http://` and `https://` URLs directly without upload.
- Add dry-run support for payload verification without credentials or network calls.
- Add status polling normalization for Market models and Veo3 tasks.
- Add tests for payload builders, input resolution, and status normalization.

### Technical Notes from Local Docs

- Market create endpoint: `POST https://api.kie.ai/api/v1/jobs/createTask`.
- Market status endpoint: `GET https://api.kie.ai/api/v1/jobs/recordInfo?taskId=...`.
- Veo create endpoint: `POST https://api.kie.ai/api/v1/veo/generate`.
- Veo status endpoint: `GET https://api.kie.ai/api/v1/veo/record-info?taskId=...`.
- Upload stream endpoint base is separate: `https://kieai.redpandaai.co/api/file-stream-upload`.
- Uploaded local files return `data.downloadUrl`, which is then used in generation payloads.

### Implementation Summary

  - Local paths upload first and use returned `downloadUrl`.
  - Dry-run mode uses deterministic upload placeholders without network calls.
- Implemented payload builders for:
  - `nano-banana-pro`
  - `gpt-image-2-text-to-image`
  - `gpt-image-2-image-to-image`
  - `grok-imagine/text-to-video`
  - `grok-imagine/image-to-video`
  - Veo3.1 family: `veo3`, `veo3_fast`, `veo3_lite`

- Added CLI commands:
  - `kie-cli upload`
  - `kie-cli image nano-banana-pro`
  - `kie-cli image gpt-image-2`
  - `kie-cli video grok`
  - `kie-cli video veo3`
  - `kie-cli job-status`
- Added tests for payload builders, media input resolution, status normalization, and dry-run CLI behavior.
- Added `README.md` with setup and usage examples.

### Verification

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m py_compile scripts/download_kie_docs.py src/kie_cli/*.py
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
```

Result:

```text
14 passed in 0.92s
```

Dry-run smoke checks verified:

- Nano Banana Pro remote image is passed through without upload.
- Veo3 local images become dry-run upload placeholders and use `FIRST_AND_LAST_FRAMES_2_VIDEO`.

### Status

Complete.

## Task 3: OpenAI-Compatible LLM Text Completion

### Request

Add OpenAI-compatible KIE GPT text completion support to the CLI.

### Planned Scope

- Use KIE's OpenAI-compatible GPT 5.2 chat completions endpoint:
  - `POST https://api.kie.ai/gpt-5-2/v1/chat/completions`
- Reuse dotenv-backed `KIE_API_KEY` configuration.
- Add a new command:
  - `kie-cli llm gpt-5-2`
- Support:
  - `--prompt`
  - `--prompt-file`
  - `--reasoning-effort low|high`
  - `--web-search`
  - `--dry-run`
  - `--json`
- Normalize OpenAI-compatible response text from:
  - `choices[0].message.content`

- Added `KieClient.create_gpt_5_2_chat_completion()` for `POST /gpt-5-2/v1/chat/completions`.
- Added `kie-cli llm gpt-5-2`.
- Supported:
  - `--prompt`
  - `--prompt-file`
  - `--reasoning-effort low|high`
  - `--web-search`
  - `--dry-run`
  - `--json`
- Added plain-text human output for successful LLM completions.
- Added tests for payload building, web-search payloads, response normalization, missing-text failures, and CLI dry-run behavior.
- Updated `README.md` with OpenAI-compatible text completion examples.

### Verification

```

Dry-run smoke output confirmed:

```json
{
  "model": "gpt-5-2",
  "kind": "chat_completions",
  "prompt": "Write a tagline.",
  "reasoning_effort": "low"
}
```

### Status

## Task 4: Model-Based Async Job Contract and Live Test Harness

### Request

Add deterministic async job handling and a safe test harness for real-key validation of image, video, and LLM flows.

### Planned Scope

- Use `model` as the public routing contract for async jobs.
- Keep Market/Veo route selection as an internal model-based heuristic.
- Add durable job records for submitted async jobs.
- Add a unified `kie-cli wait` command.
- Add `--save-job` support for image/video generation commands.
- Add deterministic synthetic fixtures for image, video, and LLM testing.
- Add gated live tests that only run when explicitly enabled.

### Implementation Summary

- Added model-based async routing in `src/kie_cli/routes.py` for Market and Veo status endpoints.
- Added durable job records in `src/kie_cli/jobs.py` with:
  - schema version
  - job ID
  - model
  - submit endpoint
  - status endpoint
  - submitted payload
  - resolved media
  - raw submit response
- Added polling helpers in `src/kie_cli/polling.py`:
  - `get_status_once()`
  - `poll_until_complete()`
  - `poll_job_record()`
- Wired CLI job features in `src/kie_cli/cli.py`:
  - `--save-job` for image/video submissions
  - `kie-cli wait --job-file ...`
  - `kie-cli wait TASK_ID --model MODEL`
  - model-preferred `job-status --model MODEL`
- Kept legacy `job-status --kind` compatibility while documenting `--model` as the preferred deterministic public contract.
- Added route/job/polling unit coverage in `tests/test_jobs_polling.py`.
- Added CLI wait/save-job coverage in `tests/test_cli_jobs.py`.
- Added deterministic prompt fixtures under `tests/fixtures/prompts/`.
- Added deterministic tiny PNG fixtures under `tests/fixtures/images/`.
- Added gated live tests in `tests/integration/test_live_kie.py`, skipped unless `RUN_KIE_LIVE_TESTS=1`.
- Added `outputs/live_tests/.gitkeep` and ignored generated live-test artifacts.
- Updated `README.md` with:
  - save-job examples
  - wait examples
  - model-based status examples
  - synthetic fixture notes
  - gated live test instructions and credit warnings

### Technical Decisions

- Public async status routing is model-based, not task-ID-prefix-based.
- `--kind` remains available only for backward compatibility on `job-status`; new scripts should use `--model`.
- Live tests are opt-in and scoped by `KIE_LIVE_SCOPE=llm|upload|generation`.
- Image/video live generation tests submit only by default; polling requires `KIE_LIVE_POLL=1`.
- Live test artifacts are written under `outputs/live_tests/<timestamp>/<case>/` and excluded from git except `.gitkeep`.

### Verification

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m py_compile scripts/download_kie_docs.py src/kie_cli/*.py
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
```

Result:

```text
33 passed, 4 skipped in 0.37s
```

The 4 skipped tests are the gated live integration tests, skipped by default because `RUN_KIE_LIVE_TESTS=1` was not set.

### Status

Complete.

## Task 5: Live Network Generation and LLM Test Matrix

### Request

Focus only on real network live tests using synthetic inputs for:

- image prompt-only
- image + prompt
- video prompt-only
- video + prompt
- LLM prompt

The docs downloader is intentionally out of scope for this follow-up.

### Implementation Summary

- Reworked `tests/integration/test_live_kie.py` into a focused live network smoke matrix.
- Kept tests gated by `RUN_KIE_LIVE_TESTS=1`.
- Added optional scope filtering with:
  - `KIE_LIVE_SCOPE=llm`
  - `KIE_LIVE_SCOPE=image`
  - `KIE_LIVE_SCOPE=video`
  - `KIE_LIVE_SCOPE=generation`
  - `KIE_LIVE_SCOPE=all`
- Live test cases now cover:
  - `kie-cli llm gpt-5-2 --prompt-file tests/fixtures/prompts/llm_prompt.txt`
  - `kie-cli image gpt-image-2 --prompt-file tests/fixtures/prompts/image_text_prompt.txt`
  - `kie-cli image gpt-image-2 --prompt-file tests/fixtures/prompts/image_reference_prompt.txt --image tests/fixtures/images/synthetic_reference_a.png`
  - `kie-cli video grok --prompt-file tests/fixtures/prompts/video_text_prompt.txt`
  - `kie-cli video grok --prompt-file tests/fixtures/prompts/video_reference_prompt.txt --image tests/fixtures/images/synthetic_reference_a.png`
- Image/video tests submit real jobs and save job records under `outputs/live_tests/<timestamp>/<case>/`.
- Image/video tests do not wait for final media unless `KIE_LIVE_POLL=1` is set.
- Updated the LLM assertion to accept KIE's provider-returned model name `gpt-5.2` as well as the CLI alias `gpt-5-2`.

### Verification

## Task 6: Rerun Live Integration QA Matrix

### Request

Rerun the most recent live QA test command from the journal and report the result.

### Verification

```bash
RUN_KIE_LIVE_TESTS=1 .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/integration -q
```

Result:

```text

5 passed in 13.93s
```

### Status

## Task 7: End-to-End Live Result Fixtures

### Request

Strengthen the live KIE integration matrix so it proves the generated outputs actually complete, not only that async jobs are submitted. The required acceptance matrix is:

- 2 completed image generations
- 2 completed video generations
- 1 completed LLM call
- full input/output fixtures persisted for inspection

### Implementation Summary

- Updated `tests/integration/test_live_kie.py` from submit-only smoke coverage to full end-to-end live validation.
- Kept the five live cases:
  - `llm-prompt`
  - `image-prompt-only`
  - `image-with-prompt`
  - `video-prompt-only`
  - `video-with-prompt`
- Changed image/video cases to always:
  - submit the generation job with `--save-job`
  - persist submit CLI input/output under `submit/`
  - wait with `kie-cli wait --job-file ... --json`
  - persist wait CLI input/output under `wait/`
  - assert final status is `succeeded`
  - assert final `outputUrls` exists and contains HTTP URLs
  - write `final.json` and `output_urls.json`
- Added per-case `case.json` fixtures describing prompts, input images, expected model, submit command, and wait command.
- Added `input_media.json` for reference-image cases to expose uploaded local image resolution.
- Made the live run root session-scoped so `outputs/live_tests/<timestamp>/manifest.json` aggregates all cases from a single pytest run.

### Technical Decisions

- Polling is no longer optional for generation live tests. If live generation runs, it must wait for final media and fail on timeout, failure, or missing output URLs.
- Poll interval and timeout remain configurable with:
  - `KIE_LIVE_POLL_INTERVAL`
  - `KIE_LIVE_TIMEOUT`
- The integration test still remains gated by `RUN_KIE_LIVE_TESTS=1` because it performs real network calls and consumes KIE credits.
- Scope filtering remains available through `KIE_LIVE_SCOPE=llm|image|video|generation|all`.

### Expected Fixture Layout

### Verification

Local gated validation:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/integration -q
```

Result:

```text
5 skipped in 0.06s
```

Initial full live acceptance run:

```bash
RUN_KIE_LIVE_TESTS=1 KIE_LIVE_POLL_INTERVAL=10 KIE_LIVE_TIMEOUT=900 .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/integration -q
```

Result:

```text
2 failed, 3 passed in 191.48s (0:03:11)
```

The LLM, prompt-only image, and prompt-only video cases succeeded. The two reference-image cases submitted and uploaded correctly but failed during KIE generation because the original synthetic reference PNG fixtures were 1x1 images.

Resolution:

- Replaced `tests/fixtures/images/synthetic_reference_a.png` with a deterministic 512x512 PNG.
- Replaced `tests/fixtures/images/synthetic_reference_b.png` with a deterministic 512x512 PNG.
- Reran the two reference-image cases successfully:

```bash
RUN_KIE_LIVE_TESTS=1 KIE_LIVE_POLL_INTERVAL=10 KIE_LIVE_TIMEOUT=900 .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/integration/test_live_kie.py -q -k "image_with_prompt or video_with_prompt"
```

Result:

```text
2 passed, 3 deselected in 84.43s (0:01:24)
```

Final full live acceptance run:

```bash
RUN_KIE_LIVE_TESTS=1 KIE_LIVE_POLL_INTERVAL=10 KIE_LIVE_TIMEOUT=900 .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/integration -q
```

Result:

```text
5 passed in 169.37s (0:02:49)
```

Final full-run fixture manifest:

```text
outputs/live_tests/20260430T020906Z/manifest.json
```

The final manifest confirms:

- `llm-prompt`: succeeded with text from `gpt-5.2`
- `image-prompt-only`: succeeded with final image URL
- `image-with-prompt`: succeeded with final image URL
- `video-prompt-only`: succeeded with final MP4 URL
- `video-with-prompt`: succeeded with final MP4 URL

### Commit Note

Prepared commit for the strengthened live acceptance workflow after confirming the full real KIE matrix passes:

```text
5 passed in 169.37s (0:02:49)
```

Final fixture manifest:

```text
outputs/live_tests/20260430T020906Z/manifest.json
```

The committed changes include the end-to-end live polling test harness, durable I/O fixture capture, journal documentation, and upgraded 512x512 synthetic reference images needed for real image/video reference generation.


### Status

Complete.

## Task 8: Gemini Vision + Text Chat Support

### Request

Add KIE Gemini API support so the CLI can submit multimodal vision + text prompts using local or remote images and return a text answer.

Primary target command:

```bash
kie-cli gemini gemini-3-pro \
  --prompt "What do you see here? Describe in canonical pop culture detail as you see fit." \
  --image tests/fixtures/images/synthetic_reference_a.png \
  --json
```

### Planned Scope

- Add Gemini model constant and payload builder.
- Use KIE's OpenAI-compatible multimodal chat format:
  - `POST /gemini-3-pro/v1/chat/completions`
  - `messages[0].content` starts with a text part.
  - Each media reference is represented as:
    - `{"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://..."}}`
- Upload local image files through the existing KIE upload API before creating the chat completion.
- Pass remote `http://` and `https://` image URLs directly without upload.
- Add a focused CLI command:
  - `kie-cli gemini gemini-3-pro`
- Support:
  - `--prompt`
  - `--prompt-file`
  - repeated `--image`
  - `--reasoning-effort low|high`
  - `--include-thoughts`
  - `--web-search`
  - `--upload-path`
  - `--dry-run`
  - `--json`
- Reuse OpenAI-compatible chat response normalization.
- Add unit tests, dry-run coverage, README examples, and a gated live integration test.

### Endpoint and Payload Shape

Endpoint:

```text
POST /gemini-3-pro/v1/chat/completions
```

Canonical payload shape:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "What do you see here? Describe in canonical pop culture detail as you see fit."
        },
        {
          "type": "image_url",
          "image_url": {
            "url": "https://..."
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "stream": false,
  "include_thoughts": false,
  "reasoning_effort": "high"
}
```

Gemini web search uses the KIE-documented Gemini function name:

```json
{
  "type": "function",
  "function": {
    "name": "googleSearch"
  }
}
```

### Implementation Summary

- Added `GEMINI_3_PRO = "gemini-3-pro"` in `src/kie_cli/llm.py`.
- Added `build_gemini_vision_payload(...)` with:
  - text-first multimodal content
  - one `image_url` part per resolved image URL
  - `stream: false` by default
  - `include_thoughts: false` by default
  - `reasoning_effort`
  - optional Gemini-specific `googleSearch` tool
- Added `KieClient.create_gemini_3_pro_chat_completion(...)` for `POST /gemini-3-pro/v1/chat/completions`.
- Added `kie-cli gemini gemini-3-pro` command in `src/kie_cli/cli.py`.
- Reused existing `resolve_media_inputs(...)` behavior:
  - local files upload to KIE temporary storage outside dry-run mode
  - remote URLs pass through directly
  - dry-run local files become deterministic `dry-run://uploaded/<name>` placeholders
- Reused `normalize_chat_completion(...)` and added `resolvedMedia` to Gemini results.
- Added Gemini unit tests and CLI dry-run coverage in `tests/test_llm.py`.
- Added gated live Gemini vision test in `tests/integration/test_live_kie.py`.
- Updated README supported model list, usage examples, and live-test commands.

### Verification

Local validation commands:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_llm.py tests/test_media_status_cli.py -q
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
```

Result:

```text
15 passed in 0.41s
36 passed, 6 skipped in 0.32s
```

Live Gemini validation command:

```bash
RUN_KIE_LIVE_TESTS=1 KIE_LIVE_SCOPE=gemini .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/integration -q
```

Observed live result during implementation:

```text
6 skipped in 9.16s
```

The Gemini request uploaded local media successfully and produced an HTTP `resolvedMedia` URL, but KIE returned a provider maintenance payload:

```json
{
  "code": 500,
  "msg": "The server is currently being maintained, please try again later~"
}
```

The live test now preserves the full I/O fixture and skips this specific transient provider-maintenance condition so the gated live suite distinguishes implementation errors from upstream Gemini availability.

Expected full live matrix after Gemini provider availability returns:

```text
6 passed
```

### Status

Implementation complete. Live Gemini success validation is blocked by upstream KIE provider maintenance at the time of testing.

## Task 9: GPT-5.2 Multimodal Image Input Support

### Request

Upgrade `kie-cli llm gpt-5-2` so it can accept image input and submit multimodal KIE GPT-5.2 chat requests using local or remote images.

Target usage:

```bash
kie-cli llm gpt-5-2 \
  --prompt "What do you see in this image?" \
  --image tests/fixtures/images/synthetic_reference_a.png \
  --json
```

### Planned Scope

- Reuse the existing GPT-5.2 chat endpoint:
  - `POST /gpt-5-2/v1/chat/completions`
- Extend the GPT-5.2 payload builder to support image content parts.
- Reuse the existing local upload flow for local image files.
- Pass remote `http://` and `https://` image URLs directly.
- Extend the existing `llm` command rather than adding a new command.
- Support:
  - `--prompt`
  - `--prompt-file`
  - repeated `--image`
  - `--reasoning-effort low|high`
  - `--web-search`
  - `--upload-path`
  - `--dry-run`
  - `--json`
- Add tests, README examples, and live integration coverage.

### Endpoint and Payload Shape

The KIE GPT-5.2 docs confirm multimodal chat on the existing endpoint and use the same image part shape as Gemini:

```text
POST /gpt-5-2/v1/chat/completions
```

Canonical multimodal request shape:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "What do you see in this image?"
        },
        {
          "type": "image_url",
          "image_url": {
            "url": "https://..."
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "reasoning_effort": "high"
}
```

GPT-5.2 web search remains:

```json
{
  "type": "function",
  "function": {
    "name": "web_search"
  }
}
```

### Implementation Summary

- Extended `build_gpt_5_2_chat_payload(...)` in `src/kie_cli/llm.py` to accept optional `image_urls`.
- Preserved backward compatibility for text-only GPT-5.2 calls.
- Updated `kie-cli llm gpt-5-2` in `src/kie_cli/cli.py` to accept:
  - repeated `--image`
  - `--upload-path` defaulting to `kie-cli/llm`
- Reused existing `resolve_media_inputs(...)` behavior:
  - local images upload before request outside dry-run mode
  - remote URLs pass through directly
  - dry-run local images become deterministic placeholders
- Updated GPT-5.2 dry-run output to include `resolvedMedia`.
- Added GPT-5.2 multimodal unit and dry-run tests in `tests/test_llm.py`.
- Added live GPT-5.2 vision test coverage in `tests/integration/test_live_kie.py`.
- Updated README with GPT-5.2 image-input examples.

### Verification

Planned validation commands:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_llm.py tests/test_media_status_cli.py -q
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
RUN_KIE_LIVE_TESTS=1 KIE_LIVE_SCOPE=llm .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/integration -q
```

### Status

Complete.
